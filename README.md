# NintenTools.Byaml

This is a .NET library to handle the BYAML Nintendo data file format, allowing you to read and store the files as either dynamic objects or strongly-typed with serialized classes similar to what the .NET `XmlReader` and `XmlWriter` provide.

The library is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syroot.NintenTools.Byaml).

## Status

It currently only supports version 1 without reference nodes, and at this time there are no plans to add support for these, and no ETA for the originally scheduled unification of the parsing logic.

## Support

You can ask questions and suggest features on Discord aswell. Feel free to [join the NintenTools channel on the Syroot server](https://discord.gg/asB4uaf)!
